Values & Value Admonitor
========================

This is the source code for Admonitor, a Firefox Add-On for the Value & Values 
project:

    https://values.doc.gold.ac.uk

It has primarily been released for those who wish to view the code and so that
others can learn from or derive code for their own use, rather than use as a 
self-contained service or product.


Values & Value is funded by an ESRC Professorial Fellowship (ES/K010786/1) and 
hosted by the Department of Sociology, Goldsmiths, University of London.
